    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      This project is part of the IE500417 course at NTNU, focusing on data visualization and machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our target user is <strong>China Coal</strong>, and we aim to provide a specialized visualization platform tailored to their needs. 
      Using datasets from the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> and <strong>Our World in Data</strong>, 
      we have created various visualizations to present insights into emissions and their health impacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project includes interactive visualizations that highlight key metrics and patterns related to emissions, 
      such as the contribution of different fuels to COâ‚‚ levels and their corresponding impact on public health. 
      Additionally, we have employed machine learning techniques to predict how a 20% reduction in emissions 
      could potentially decrease the number of deaths attributable to air pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to combine data-driven insights with user-friendly visualizations to empower decision-making 
      and promote better environmental practices.
